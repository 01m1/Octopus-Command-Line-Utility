Thank You very much for giving me the opportunity to take part in this programming exercise.

I had a lot of fun developing this command line utility and hope to be able to do more stuff like this.

Since I had time, I decided to also allow the command line utility to output IDs (along with the value or date) of the highest/lowest/oldest/newest meter readings. This meant that I also had to check for meter readings with the same date/value.
