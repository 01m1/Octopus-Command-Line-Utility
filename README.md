Thank You very much for giving me the opportunity to take part in this coding challenge.

I had a lot of fun developing this command line utility and hope to be able to do more stuff like this.

Since I had time, I decided to also allow the command line utility to output IDs (along with the value or date) of the highest/lowest/oldest/newest meter readings. This meant that I also had to check for meter readings with the same date/value.

With more time, I would have added more unit tests and allowed unit tests to be done with different meter reading flows other than the one provided. I also could have looked into providing some extra statistics.
